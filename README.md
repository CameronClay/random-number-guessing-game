# Random Number Guessing Game
Random number guessing game built in Rust. This is my first Rust project made as a part of learning the rust language. The game functions the same in the three versions provided; in each new version the source code was modified to explore new rust features and improve the source code.

## Unit Testing
- Some unit testing is done inline in source files (with inline modules).
